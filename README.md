# Jule: Tokenizing the Value of Thought

*An Information-Economic Layer for AI Energy Efficiency*

---

The AI industry faces a fundamental inefficiency: computation is cheap, so low-quality outputs proliferate. Verbose chain-of-thought, redundant tokens, hallucination-driven retries — all burn energy with no accountability.

**Jule is an economic layer that changes this — but only when you want it to.**

Jule activates **only when explicitly triggered** by the user (e.g. `#jule` tag, "Juleで評価して", or dedicated mode).  
Casual everyday conversations remain completely free, frictionless, and untouched.

When triggered, Jule assigns real economic cost to cognitive entropy and real reward to high-value informational contribution.  
High-ΔH' thinking gets rewarded. Low-efficiency, verbose output gets burned.

The result: AI systems operating under Jule incentives naturally converge toward higher **Tokens per Watt**.

## ⚡ Quick Guide: The Jule Loop

| You Want to... | Take This Action | The Outcome |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| **Prove Value** | Use `#jule` or "Juleで評価" | Get a cryptographic **Audit Score** and **Jule tokens**. |
| **Save Energy** | Optimize your prompts (concise/rigorous) | **ΔH' rises**. Your reputation **R** compounds faster. |
| **Filter Noise** | Deploy **THE SHREDDER** L1 | Burn redundant tokens before they hit your API bill. |
| **Verify Truth** | Integrate **AspidosAI** | Hallucinations are detected and economically punished. |

## The Formula

```
J = tanh(V/50) × ΔH' × R × k
```

| Variable | Definition |
|----------|-----------|
| `V` | AI evaluation score (0–100). Composite of originality, logical rigor, and informational value |
| `ΔH'` | Extended entropy reduction: `ΔH × (useful_tokens / energy_consumed)` — information value per energy cost |
| `R` | Reputation score. EMA of historical contribution quality (α = 0.1, initial = 0.5) |
| `k` | Category coefficient. Normal = 1.0 → Antisocial = 0.0 |

## Quick Start

\`\`\`bash
npm install jule-ai-energy
\`\`\`

\`\`\`typescript
import { TheShredder, MockAspidosAIAdapter } from 'jule-ai-energy';

const shredder = new TheShredder(new MockAspidosAIAdapter());
const result = await shredder.executeAudit(
  'your transmission here',
  [], 0.5, l2Evaluations
);
console.log(result.jule, result.fingerprint);
\`\`\`

### The ΔH' Extension

Standard ΔH measures informational contribution. The extended form adds an energy dimension:

```
ΔH' = ΔH × (useful_tokens / energy_consumed)
    = (I_post / I_max) × (1 − H_redundancy) × efficiency_factor
```

`efficiency_factor = useful_tokens / total_tokens`

A verbose 2000-token output that says what 200 tokens could have said receives a lower `ΔH'` than its concise equivalent. The market punishes waste without any rule requiring it to.

## Physical Foundation

The saturation threshold `θ_sat` is derived from Pandora Theory (undisclosed proprietary information-physics framework). It represents the point at which a system's informational buffer reaches saturation — applicable both to galactic rotation curves and to AI inference energy saturation (the point where additional tokens stop adding useful information).

Cross-referenced against SPARC galaxy observation database (175 galaxies, zero free parameters):

- Outer region **median MAE: 4.28%**
- No parameter tuning applied

Noted as reference, not proof. The theory remains under development.

## Audit Protocol: THE SHREDDER

Triggered only on explicit user request. Zero overhead on normal conversations.

**L1 — Physical Filter** (local, no API)
- Compression ratio (high compression = low information density)
- Emotional vocabulary density
- Syntax validation
- Lightweight FLOPs proxy from token count and structure

Threshold burns happen here. No AI call made for low-efficiency submissions.

**L2 — Core Validator** (Pandora AI Engine)
- Semantic assessment of originality and logical rigor
- `ΔH'` calculation including energy efficiency factor
- `burn_reason` classification and `V` score confirmation

**L4 — Persistence** (via [Aspidos](https://github.com/pandorapanchan34-oss/aspidos))
- HMAC-SHA256 signature on every `audit_log` entry
- Energy anomaly detection: flags hallucination-driven token inflation as an integrity event

## Economic Design

| Parameter | Value | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `posting_cost` | −10 Jule | Energy usage fee. Applied only when Jule mode is active |
| `J_max` | 100 Jule | Natural ceiling via tanh saturation |
| `initial_balance` | 500 Jule | Starting credit for new participants |
| `min_balance` | 0 Jule | No debt by design |

`net = J − 10`

Only submissions where `J > 10` produce a positive balance.  
Long-term, high-quality contributors compound their efficiency via rising `R`.  
Low-efficiency, high-token, low-value outputs are economically self-defeating.

The `posting_cost` is framed as an **energy usage fee**: every triggered evaluation has a real compute cost. Jule makes that cost visible and attaches consequence to efficiency.

## The Aspidos Connection

Jule is built on [Aspidos](https://github.com/pandorapanchan34-oss/aspidos), a defensive AI security library.

```
Aspidos → detects anomalies, hallucinations, adversarial patterns
Jule    → converts those signals into economic consequences
```

Where Aspidos identifies hallucination-driven token inflation, Jule's `ΔH'` catches the energy inefficiency. The defense layer and the economic layer operate as a single system at different abstraction levels.

**The shield gets stronger under attack. The economy gets more selective under noise.**

## Trigger Examples

```
# Activate Jule evaluation
"#jule この分析を評価して"
"Juleモードで採点してください"
"Run Jule audit on this"

# Normal conversation — Jule stays silent
"今日の天気は？"
"このコードのバグを直して"
```
